# League_Of_Legends_Match_winner_prediction
The purpose of the project is to analyse a dataset and predict the winner of the match before a match has been started on the basis of players historical data. The statistical algorithm ‘Logistic Regression’ would also be used to train the dataset and predict an assigned binary target variable. The data of League of Legends pre match 2021’ is used for analysis. League of Legends, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defence of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. A proper analysis of the data will help in bringing out meaningful insights.
